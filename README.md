# ðŸŽ® Space Defender
Space Defender - Action game

Game levels in this project are presented in the visa of the planets.  

Planets are of two types:  
- space
- ground  

The view of the planet depends on the location of the device (horizontally/vertically).  
The main task of the player when passing the level is to defeat the boss. When the boss is defeated, a new planet (level) is unlocked.  
It is possible to change the difficulty level in the game.
